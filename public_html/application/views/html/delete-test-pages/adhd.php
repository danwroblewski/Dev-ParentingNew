			<p>For parents raising children with ADHD, calls from their child’s school seem endless. The difficulties of parenting a hyperactive, disorganized, inattentive, forgetful, aggressive child may threaten to overwhelm them. Dr. Bowers was one such parent.</p>
			
			<p>With a father’s insight and a clinician’s knowledge, Dr. Bowers examines the challenges a child with ADHD presents and offers parents workable, effective ways of handling the behavior problems. In this book, parents will discover how to address their child’s issues at school, at meals and bedtime, with siblings and peers, and out in public. The tools Dr. Bowers provides can empower frustrated or fearful parents to approach raising a child who has ADHD with renewed hope and confidence.</p>
