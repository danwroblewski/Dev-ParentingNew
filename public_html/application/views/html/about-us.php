			<h2>Boys Town<sup>&reg;</sup> and Parenting.org<sup>SM</sup></h2>
			
			<p>Every day, through programs nationwide, Boys Town reaches out to fragile children and families in need of compassionate and effective care. We lift them up, heal their wounds and put them on the path to a brighter futures.</p>
			
			<p>Boys Town has been saving children and healing families for more than 90 years for two reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have an unwavering belief in the inherent potential that exists in each child, no matter what their circumstances.</li>
				<li>We have the skill and knowledge to develop youth and family services that provide lasting, life-changing results.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The heart of our service lies in our Integrated Continuum of Care, which touches the lives of over 400,000 at-risk children and families each year. The Continuum is unique and provides a tightly integrated spectrum of research-proven services based on the consistent delivery of the Boys Town Model<sup>SM</sup>.</p>
			
			<p>We specialize in training, consulting and researching parenting practices that can help you in the day-to-day development of your children.</p>
			
			<p>The Integrated Continuum of Care provides the right treatment, at the right time, in the right way, for the right amount of time. This unique approach enables us to help more children and families in more ways, with the same expectations for positive results.</p>
			
			<p>What weâ€™ve learned in developing the Continuum and caring for children and families for the past 90 years has been adapted and made available to ALL PARENTS through channels like Parenting.org<sup>SM</sup>.</p>
